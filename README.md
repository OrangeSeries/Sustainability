# Sustainability, You and I, we are all responsible
How to develop a sustainable IT strategy

Sustainability is a very important topic for our clients, for ourselves and the world! Therefore we wrote a book on how our IT choices can be made more sustainable: Sustainabe IT is not an illusion. While  writing our book we were pleasantly surprised by the number of topics that clould have positive impact on IT sustainability.
The writing of this book was a fantastic learning curve for us.
We initially wrote this book in Dutch, but as there was international demand we translated it into English. We are delighted to present this book which explains the role of IT and environment, the role of IT and ethics and the role of IT in our society. Wether you are a CSO, architect, CIO, engineer or any other IT person you have a great responsibility!
You can use this book to become aware, start the learning curve and become a sustainable professional!

In the downloads folder you will find two "identical" books one in English and one in Dutch and you will find the second edition, which is only available in Dutch because it contains contributions of Dutch organizations.
